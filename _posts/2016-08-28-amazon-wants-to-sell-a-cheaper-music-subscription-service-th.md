title: Amazon is your new butler

description: >-
  Amazon is invading your home now. According to recode theyâ€™re going to sell
  all you can listen flatrate at 10$ a month. In September we will already see
  the first rollouts, those results will surely make a point for the future.  I
  am really curious to see what will happen next on Amazons Strategy. As it
  looks they still work on growth. After they announced earlier that they are
  testing out part time.
