            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>My Perfect 24 Hours, If I Were a Teleporting Billionaire | Travel Away</h1><p>Bear with me on this one. Let's say it's summer, end of August to be more precise. I live in Romania, I am a billionaire, and, of course, teleportation is possible. To make it easier for you to calculate (if you want to), use the Eastern European time (UTC+2).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d514394de715e2d49831dc9410ecb72b24380f6d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Illustration</h1><p>As part of his Celestial Series, Chicago-based digital artist David Brodeur rendered an alien world filled with berry-like plants, glowing crystals, and candy shaped orbs that sprout from the ground. Despite their exotic designs, Brodeur relies on common colors of familiar fruits to create this Willy Wonka-esque habitat where you can't help but want to reach out and gobble everything up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4d6c337dd3c98bcadd87c6b27fd94f1493ae65eb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
